# Toy Transformer LLM

This is a transformer created for my portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in state of the art machine learning technology, particularly in regards to deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project is not intended for production use, but the project demonstrates key principles in LLMs like GPT and BERT, utilizing modern libraries such as PyTorch and Tensorflow.

## Roadmap

For now, the project is incomplete, but I plan on working the project out in these phases:

- [ ] **Tokenization and Vocabulary Generation**
- [ ] **Design and Train Embedding**
- [ ] **Create Transformer Components**
- [ ] **Assemble Transformer**
- [ ] **Design and Execute Training**
- [ ] **Evaluate Performance**
